# ttfinder-android


This app  contains an automated process using the ANNETTE algorithm to evaluate images and provide immediate feedback on whether

1. the individual has TT and needs further assessment, 
2. the individual does not have TT and does not need further assessment 
3. the image quality is adequate but the findings are inconclusive and 
4. the image quality is insufficient and additional images are needed. 

Typically, the user will receive this feedback immediately after taking the images; however, for the pilot testing described below, the user will just receive feedback on whether the image is adequate quality for the algorithm to run.
